A gag game I made one night. There is a way to win but it's kind of a pun.
Strangely, this is probably my most "polished" game yet. I really love the pixel
art for the lock and scroll and the sound effects when objects collide. This is
also the first time I've really delved into the Unity Physics2D Joints to make
the slider for the lock and a spring joint for mouse dragging.

<b>The Invisible Hand (Fall 2016 - Winter 2016)</b><br>

A turn based fantasy resource management game.
In this game you run a small fantasy shop buying supplies and selling goods.
Will you try to make the most money at the risk of being hated by your community
or will you cut back on profits to improve your reputation? It's still a work in progress
so I literally cannot tell you which is the better strategy<br><br>
  
<b> UPDATE: </b> We ultimately scrapped the multiple endings based on reputation or gold
in order to focus on making the one ending we did have effective. In hindsight, trying
to preoptimize event construction ended up constricting event possibilities more than
I had anticipated. Also, I feel as though I could have done better at giving each
member of the programming team work to do.<br><br>
  
Made for the UCI Video Game Development Club by a team of six people:<br>
Hiroshi Estrada (Production Manager)<br>
Matt Robertson (Writer)<br>
Danielle Mariano (Artist)<br>
Al Miranda (Programmer)<br>
Krishen Bhan (Programmer)<br>
Henry Smith (Programmer) (Me)

<b>2D Tile Pool Test (Fall 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/HenrySmithUCI/2D-Tile-Pool-Test">GitHub</a> |
<a href="https://henrysmithuci.github.io/2D-Tile-Pool-Test/">Playable link</a><br>
A test for pooling Tile objects. By loading only the tiles in the
camera view and unloading tiles outside the view saves a lot on
rendering time. This is especially useful if you have a tiled world
with hundreds or thousands of tiles.<br><br>

This was origionally made for a 2D 4X Strategy game RPG hybrid
concept. I may finish it one day but I felt like getting
to this point was enough to share

<b>Astro Jump (Fall 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/unheardCARNAGE/Barrel-Time">GitHub</a> |
<a href="https://tcharvey.itch.io/astro-jump">Download Page</a><br>
An infinate runner where you play as an astronaut jumping
over lava on a giant wheel. Yeah, it's weird, but pretty fun though!<br><br>

Origionally titled "Barrel-Time" before we had any assets,
This game was made for the VGDC Fall 2016 Game Jam. This
was the first time I had ever particiapted in a formal game
jam (There were some minor jams within my high school, but
it never really amounted to anything). I worked as a
programmer as well as animator since I was the only
one who knew anything about Unity's animation system
which even then I don't know that much.

<b>Lights (Fall 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/HenrySmithUCI/Lights">GitHub</a> |
<a href="https://henrysmithuci.github.io/Lights/">Playable link</a><br>
A cute and abstract game where you play as a flashing light
Beyond that its a little hard to explain, so play it yourself!<br><br>

This game is actually based on an earlier game I made in 2014 (I think)
which I sadly lost the code for. That game was made in javascript and
was slightly different (no sounds and a few other minor changes) However,
I see this game as a sort of "Look how far I've come" when comparing to
my earlier works.<br><br>

The piano sounds are from <a href="http://undertale.com/">Undertale</a>

<b>General Graphing Canvas (Summer 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/HenrySmithUCI/General-Graphing-Canvas"> GitHub</a> |
<a href="https://henrysmithuci.github.io/General-Graphing-Canvas/">"Playable" link</a><br>
A so-light-weight-it's-pretty-much-useless library for javascript I made just to make
a few small projects I was working on easier. Can render curves and rays and points
and such.<br><br>

I made this while on a train from London to Edinburgh during my summer vacation.
It was pretty fun to make, but I'm probably not going to use it so much since for
the most part I've just been using Unity and Python recently

<b>The Perfect Existentialist (Spring 2016 - Summer 2016)</b><br>

Does life really matter? This Absurd game tackles that question with all the
wit and thought provoking commentary of a high-schooler doing a book report.
Regardless, I'm increadibly proud of how this adventure game turnned out.
I learned a great deal about Unity UI, parsing XML, and compiling and debugging
in unity and C#.<br><br>

Yes, this game was made as a high-school report on "The Stranger",
"Metamorphosis", and "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."
I got an A+ ;)<br><br>

My essential commentary was that to find meaning in life an
individual must question their reality and constantly learn
and remain curious.<br><br>

I genuinely beleive that and try to learn as much as I can in the time I have.

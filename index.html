Hey there! this is my homepage. Various projects I have made or contributed to are below.<br>
I don't have any css or fancy stuff on this page because dammit Jim I'm a programmer not a graphic designer!<br>
<br>

<b>The Invisible Hand (Fall 2016 - Current) (WIP)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/HenrySmithUCI/The-Invisible-Hand">GitHub</a><br>
A turn based fantasy resource management game.<br>
In this game you run a small fantasy shop: buying supplies and selling goods.<br>
Will you try to make the most money at the risk of being hated by your community<br>
or will you cut back on profits to improve your reputation? It's still a work in progress<br>
so I literally cannot tell you which is the better strategy<br><br>

This game was made for the UCI Video Game Development Club by a team of six people:<br>
Hiroshi Estrada (Production Manager)<br>
Matt Robertson (Writer)<br>
Danielle Mariano (Artist)<br>
Al Miranda (Programmer)<br>
Krishen Bhan (Programmer)<br>
Henry Smith (Programmer) (Me)<br><br>

<b>2D Tile Pool Test (Fall 2016)</b><br>

A test for pooling Tile objects. By loading only the tiles in the<br>
camera view and unloading tiles outside the view saves a lot on<br>
rendering time. This is especially useful if you have a tiled world<br>
with hundreds or thousands of tiles.<br>

This was origionally made for a 2D 4X Strategy game RPG hybrid<br>
concept. I may finish it one day but I felt like getting<br>
to this point was enough to share<br><br>

<b>Astro Jump (Fall 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/unheardCARNAGE/Barrel-Time">GitHub</a><br>
<a href="https://tcharvey.itch.io/astro-jump">Download Page</a><br>
An infinate runner where you play as an astronaut jumping<br>
over lava on a giant wheel. Yeah, it's weird, but pretty fun though!<br><br>

Origionally titled "Barrel-Time" before we had any assets,<br>
This game was made for the VGDC Fall 2016 Game Jam. This<br>
was the first time I had ever particiapted in a formal game<br>
jam (There were some minor jams within my high school, but<br>
it never really amounted to anything). I worked as a<br>
programmer as well as animator since I was the only<br>
one who knew anything about Unity's animation system<br>
which even then I don't know that much.<br><br>

<b>Lights (Fall 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/HenrySmithUCI/Lights">GitHub</a><br>
<a href="https://henrysmithuci.github.io/Lights/">Playable link</a><br>
A cute and abstract game where you play as a flashing light<br>
Beyond that its a little hard to explain, so play it yourself!<br><br>

This game is actually based on an earlier game I made in 2014 (I think)<br>
which I sadly lost the code for. That game was made in javascript and<br>
was slightly different (no sounds and a few other minor changes) However,<br>
I see this game as a sort of "Look how far I've come" when comparing to<br>
my earlier works.<br><br>

The piano sounds are from <a href="http://undertale.com/">Undertale</a><br>

<b>General Graphing Canvas (Summer 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/HenrySmithUCI/General-Graphing-Canvas"> GitHub</a><br>
<a href="https://henrysmithuci.github.io/General-Graphing-Canvas/">"Playable" link</a><br>
A so-light-weight-it's-pretty-much-useless library for javascript I made just to make<br>
a few small projects I was working on easier. Can render curves and rays and points<br>
and such.<br><br>

I made this while on a train from London to Edinburgh during my summer vacation.<br>
It was pretty fun to make, but I'm probably not going to use it so much since for<br>
the most part I've just been using Unity and Python recently<br>

<br>
<b>The Perfect Existentialist (Spring 2016 - Summer 2016)</b><br>
<a href="https://github.com/HenrySmithUCI/The-Perfect-Existentialist">GitHub</a><br>
<a href="https://henrysmithuci.github.io/The-Perfect-Existentialist/">Playable link</a><br>
Does life really matter? This absurd game tackles that question with all the<br>
wit and thought provoking commentary of a high-schooler doing a book report.<br>
Regardless, I'm increadibly proud of how this adventure game turnned out.<br>
I learned a great deal about Unity UI, parsing XML, and compiling and debugging<br>
in unity and C#.<br><br>

Yes, this game was made as a high-school report on "The Stranger",<br>
"Metamorphosis", and "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."<br>
I got a prefect score ;)<br><br>

My essential commentary was that to find meaning in life an<br>
individual must question their reality and constantly learn<br>
and remain curious.<br><br>

I genuinely beleive that and try to learn something new every day.<br>
